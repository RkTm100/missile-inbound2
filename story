a went to store and bought some ice cream from b's ice store, c was the cashier.
d was behind a. e was outside the store.
I will sue the CEO of Github INC. There is a missile inbound to hit the ice cream store, it seems that the russians don't like ice creame so they decided to launch an attack against our beloved ice cream products. we must retaliate, thankfully nothing was killed or injured in the battle.
But this is a act of war, we will destroy their defenses one by one.
